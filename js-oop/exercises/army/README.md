# Create your own Army

You are going to take over the JavaScript world with a new army of `Soldier` objects.

Create a new soldier constructor function that allows you to create soldiers.

- A soldier should be able to have a `name` and `number`
- The default type of a solder should be **foot-soldier**
- Each soldier in the army should have the same `battleCry()`, an alert of "FREEDOM!" with their `name`
- Your army should have a general who's type is **general**

Try copying/pasting your code into your console and checking to make sure that everything works!
