# Slidey McShowington

Life's easier when it takes place against a backdrop of soothing pictures.

Create a webpage, the background of which is a slideshow that cycles through 5 different images, changing the background every 3 seconds. (I recommend using images hosted on Imgur.com.)

Please touch only the `slidey_js.js` file.

Once you've completed the assignment, see how many of the suggestions below you can incorporate!

Here's an example:

---

**Make it so** that when the image is changing, the old image fades out, and the new image fades in.

---

**Make it so** that the image changes on its own every 5 seconds or so.

---

**Make it so** the user can stop the slideshow.

*(From this point forward, you can touch the `slidey.html` file, too!)*

---

**Make it so** the user can change how much time passes between slides, and/or how the slides transition (fading versus sliding, for instance).

---

**Make it so** the background image is randomly-generated by the Giphy API. 

```
http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random?api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC&rating=pg&tag=funny+cat
```

To use the API, just replace `funny+cat` with the search terms you want.

Note that the API returns a JSON string, which you'll need to parse in order to get the URL of the image you want.

More documentation is available here:

GIFs can be pretty memory-heavy and may not load right away. Try to set up the timing of your API calls so that the slideshow isn't interrupted due to images not having loaded.

---

**Make it so** the user can choose their theme by typing in a text field and hitting `return`.
