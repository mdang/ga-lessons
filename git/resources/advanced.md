 - Free to experiment without impacting others
- Working with Git
 - Working directory
 - Staging area

## Why do we need a centralized repository? (GitHub)

* work in teams
* backup our data in case our machine crashes
* resume
* social

#### Cloning vs Forking a repository

A **clone** is a copy of an existing repository. We can create as many clones as we want, wherever we want.

**Forking** creates a copy of someone else's GitHub repo to your GitHub account. The forked repo is not perfectly identical - but it includes all the same source files, issues, and commit history.
  - Used for open source contributions so that not everyone has to have write access to the code in order to contribute
  - Propose bug fixes

#### Cloning an existing GitHub repository 

**We Do**

``` git clone git@github.com:ga-students/wdi-atx-7-class.git ```

#### Forking an open source project

Search for any popular repository and show how easy it is to fork into our own repository

**NOTE:** Students will be using a variation of the following link to submit homework:

https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow

1. Fork the homework repo
2. Clone your version of the repo 
3. Add a remote ```upstream``` 
4. To get the latest updates, they will run ``` git pull upstream master ```
5. They will then submit a pull request 

#### Create your own GitHub repository

https://github.com/new

> Initialize the repo with a README or there won't be a master branch

**You Do**

Clone the repository you just created on GitHub

#### Pushing changes back to your remote repository

``` git push ``` / ``` git push origin master ```

#### Pulling down the latest updates 

* ``` git fetch ``` - Obtains the latest updates from the remote repository
* ``` git merge ``` - Merges the new updates with your existing working copy
* ``` git pull ``` - A combination of both fetch and merge

## We Do

Update the class repo with the Git Haiku class exercise. Have the students do a ``` git pull ``` to get the updates

## Pull Requests

Why create pull requests? What are they used for?

## Branches

Branching allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work and experiment without messing up the main line. 

Git stores data as a series of snapshots, with pointers to versions of files. A branch is a lightweight pointer that refers to a particular commit. 

> Whiteboard the main "branch", and show development branches coming out of it

The default branch name in Git is ``` master ```. It's not special in any way other then it's automatically created when you use ``` git commit ```. Most people don't bother to change it. 

*Because a branch in Git is in actuality a simple file that contains the 40 character SHA-1 checksum of the commit it points to, branches are cheap to create and destroy. Creating a new branch is as quick and simple as writing 41 bytes to a file (40 characters and a newline).*

*This is in sharp contrast to the way most older VCS tools branch, which involves copying all of the projectâ€™s files into a second directory. This can take several seconds or even minutes, depending on the size of the project, whereas in Git the process is always instantaneous.*

### Create a branch

Creating a branch creates a new pointer to the same series of commits as ``` master ```

HEAD is a special pointer to the local branch that you're currently on. In this case it's still ``` master ``` because we haven't switched to our new branch yet. 

``` 
# This creates the branch but doesn't switch to it
git branch testing 
```

```
# This creates the branch and switches to it
git checkout -b testing
```

### Switch between branches 

HEAD now points to our ``` testing ``` branch.

**Switching branches changes the files in your working directory**

``` git checkout testing ```

### Merge a branch

Check out the branch you wish to merge into and then run the ``` git merge ``` command

```git
git checkout master
git merge testing
```

To update the current branch with changes from master, merge master into the branch

```git
git checkout testing
git merge origin/master
git push origin master
```

Alternatively, you can rebase: 

```git
git fetch
git rebase origin/master
```

#### Destroy a branch 

```git
git branch -d testing
```

## Merge conflicts

While running ``` git merge ```, if you edited part of a file that would be further altered by the merge, you'll get a merge conflict. It looks like this: 

```
$ git merge testing
Auto-merging index.html
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

To resolve: 

Run ``` git status ``` to verify all the files that could not be merged

Open up the file(s) with a conflict

```
<<<<<<< HEAD:index.html
<div id="footer">contact : email.support@github.com</div>
=======
<div id="footer">
 please contact us at support@github.com
</div>
>>>>>>> iss53:index.html
```

Resolve the conflict and remove any markers added by Git 

Run ``` git add ``` on any files you updates

Run ``` git status ``` to verify all conflicts have been resolved

```
$ git status
On branch master
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

    modified:   index.html
```

Run ``` git commit -m "Message" ``` 

## Class Exercise: Most Important & Most Confusing

**2 min**

* Describe the most important thing you learned about Git today 
* What is most confusing? 

## Remote Branches

``` origin ``` is not special, it's the default name given when you clone a git repo

To view remote branches, use: 

``` 
git remote -v 
```

#### Pushing to remote branches

``` git push origin testing ```

#### Deleting a remote branch

``` git push origin --delete serverfix ```
