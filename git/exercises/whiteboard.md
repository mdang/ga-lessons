## Git Whiteboard

**10 min - Pair Exercise**

This exercise will help students understand the value of using a version control system like Git. 

1. Split up into pairs, and grab a whiteboard marker
2. The first person writes out a full complete sentence
3. The second person edits the original sentence in any way they want
4. (2 min) Go back and forth editing the sentence until time is up

Questions afterwards:

- What was the third edit made?
- What was your favorite version of the sentence?
- What time was the fifth edit made? 
- Ask students what could we have done to save the state, what strategies could we have employed? 
  - How might this have worked if it was code? What would we have to do to make it work? 
  - Maybe copy the file over and over? 
  - Rename them with names like "new", "final", "newest", etc.
