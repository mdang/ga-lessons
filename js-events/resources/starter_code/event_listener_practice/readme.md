#### Fix An Event Listener

We've provided you with three files: `index.html` `style.css` and `main.js`.  

Your job is to add event handlers to create the following functionality...
* When the user hovers a mouse cursor over the `<div>`, the background of the page should turn blue.
* When user's mouse cursor is no longer hovering over the `<div>`, the background of the page should turn white.  

You have been provided with two functions -- `changeBackgroundColorToBlue` and `changeBackgroundColorToWhite` -- that can be used as callbacks. You do not need to change the content of these functions.
