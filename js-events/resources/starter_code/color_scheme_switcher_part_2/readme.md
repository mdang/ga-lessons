# Color Scheme Switcher

Attached is the completed HTML and CSS for an incredibly advanced website. In anticipation of the millions of viewers it's going to draw, we'd like to let users customize their experience by choosing a color scheme for the site.

The only downside is none of us know Javascript!

Update the `main.js` file such that when a user clicks on one of the colored dots the background color of the entire page changes to match that dot. You should not need to change any HTML or CSS.

**Hint**: Classes for each color have already been defined in `style.css`. Using these will DRY up your code considerably.
