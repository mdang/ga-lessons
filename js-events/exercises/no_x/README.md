### No X's

**Pair Programming - 20 min**

You have a new client that despises the letter "**x**" with a passion. Make sure this text input prevents users from typing in the letter "**x**" as they type.

Tips:
* Look through the list of DOM events and find one that will work for this situation
* Remember the ```event``` object that's passed as the first argument into event handlers
* Search for the list of key codes reported when a user presses a key on the webpage
* Don't believe everything you see on the web. You might have to do some debugging with `console.log()`
