### What's My Name?

**20min**

Let's display a person's first and last name really large on the page so that they don't forget what it is.

* Using jQuery, create a ``` click ``` event handler that will capture the form contents when the user clicks the "**Show my name**" button
* Display their first and last name onto the page by manipulating the DOM.

**BONUS**: Add a "```<select>```" element with options for "Mr, Mrs, Ms" and display the user's selection on the page also.
