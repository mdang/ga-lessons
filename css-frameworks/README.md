## What is Responsive Design?

"Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience— easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices (from desktop computer monitors to laptops to cellphones).

A site designed with RWD adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids, flexible images, etc..."

## Go mobile first 

Start with a mobile optimized website with the most important content/features, then build a more fully featured desktop version on top of that. 

#### Why is it important to go mobile first? 

<img src="./assets/926749-st-peters-2013.jpg">

In early 2014, mobile internet usage surpassed PC internet usage for the first time. Most of this is traffic from apps, but easily shows how important designing for mobile is. 

Earlier this year (2015), Google stopped displaying websites that are not mobile friendly in mobile search results.  

In the US:

* 94% of users search for local information on their phones. Nearby restaurants, directions, etc. 
* 77% of all mobile searches are done at home, where the user also has access to their PC

#### How do you make websites mobile friendly? 

Test your site to see if it's mobile friendly: 
> https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly

* Figure out the main objectives for the site and make it easy for them to accomplish these objectives 
* Use a responsive web design that lays out content optimized for the current screen size
* If the user has to pinch/zoom to view content, then it's not considered mobile friendly
* Keep users in one browser window, it can often be difficult to navigate back
* Even better, keep them on the same page and minimize full page loads when possible
* Do not use fixed width elements 

#### Differences between a responsive website and a mobile-specific website

**Responsive Web Design**

Automatically adapts and adjusts itself to the available viewing area

PROS
* One website and codebase for multiple devices - easier to maintain 
* One website url, no redirects to something like m.facebook.com
* Lower cost of development - 1 website instead of 2

CONS
* You're trying to optimize the UX for two very different platforms
* Some older devices and browsers won't present the design as you'd expect

**Mobile Specific Website**

PROS
* User experience is optimized for both platforms. Fully takes into consideration the benefits and downsides of each platform
* Speed - No downloading any unneccessary code, page will load faster 

CONS 
* Cost - More expensive to maintain two sites 
* Multiple URL's. User has to know both URL's or more likely have to wait for a redirect which will delay the process a couple of seconds

#### Examples of responsive websites

> http://foodsense.is

> http://time.com

> https://www.spotify.com/us/

#### Set the viewport

The meta viewport tag gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling

```HTML
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

**width=device-width** Mobile browsers will by default render the site at a desktop screen width and then try to make that content look better by increasing font sizes and scaling the content. This setting instructs the browser to set the width to the actual device width and reflow content according to the actual screen size. 

**initial-scale=1** When changing the orientation of the device, mobile browsers will keep the page width constant and zoom into the content. This attribute instructs the browser to use a 1:1 relationship between CSS pixels and device pixels regardless of orientation.

![Differences with viewport](./assets/68747470733a2f2f646576656c6f706572732e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f7765626d6173746572732f6d6f62696c652d73697465732f696d67732f6d6f62696c652d73656f2f76696577706f72742e706e67.png)

#### Size content to the viewport

Don't use fixed widths 

## Grids
### Why use a CSS grid?

#### Structure
* Grids are a simple way to apply layout to a webpage. A better layout improves the user experience.
* Grids help avoid stressful CSS debugging by starting out on the right foot.

#### Reusability
* Grids make the layout process easier because of reusable, semantically-named "utility classes" (i.e., a library of CSS class selectors).
* Grids aren't limited to a particular project. We can apply them to pretty much everything we do.
* Grids are highly customizable. You can really make them your own.

_Even if you don't use a grid system, these concepts will translate across other layout problems._

### Basic components of a grid

#### Rows
* The highest-level component of a grid.
* Comprised of columns.

#### Columns
* Contain and separate site content.

#### Gutters
* Provides spacing between our columns. Optional, but useful.

## What is Class-based CSS?

Create modular classes that *encapsulate* a certain behavior and name them semantically.

How would you style CSS for these elements?

* `.shout` —  make all of the characters uppercase in the element's text
* `.shadow` — add a drop-shadow to text inside the element
* `.invert` — flip an element upside-down

<details><summary>Example solution</summary>

```css
.shout {
	text-transform: uppercase;
}

.shadow {
	text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black;
}

.invert {
	transform: rotate(180deg);
}
```

## Bootstrap

Many workplaces use an extablished grid system, such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

Bootstrap is a **library of CSS classes** that helps make any old site look nice with very little effort. It comes with a **grid system** that makes laying out content on a variety of screen sizes much easier to deal with. Proficiency in at least one CSS framework allows you to make better first impressions when people land on your page.

Features:

1. Grid system
1. Forms/buttons
1. Navigation
1. Tabs and pills
1. Alerts/error messages
1. Modals
1. And much more

Today we will be taking a look at the grid system that Bootstrap provides. 

Take a look at the [Bootstrap Expo](http://expo.getbootstrap.com/) site to see some examples of sites that use Bootstrap.

#### Setup

To add Bootstrap to a project:

1. Download Bootstrap [here](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/)
2. Once downloaded, unzip and open folder in Finder. You’ll see something like this:
	
	![](assets/bootstrap_files.png)
3. Move the `bootstrap.css` file (and any other files you want to use) into the `css` folder in your project
4. Add a `<link>` tag in the head of your page to include the file:
	`<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.min">`
		

#### How it works

Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile-first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases.

Page layouts are created through a series of rows and columns that house your content.

Similar to the grid system we created together in class, Bootstrap includes predefined classes for easy layout options:

![](assets/bootstrap_classes.png)

#### Steps to use Bootstrap

1. Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents and house our grid system. You may choose one of two containers to use in your projects:
	- Use `.container` for a responsive fixed width container.
	
		```css
		<div class="container">
			...
		</div>
		```
	- Use `.container-fluid` for a full width container, spanning the entire width of your viewport.

		```css
		<div class="container-fluid">
		  ...
		</div>
		```
2. Add rows
	- Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns.
	- Only columns may be immediate children of rows.
	
	```css
	<div class="container-fluid">
		<div class="row">
			(columns)
		</div>
	</div>
	```
3. Add columns
	
	```css
	<div class="container-fluid">
		<div class="row">
		  <div class="col-md-5">.col-md-5</div>
		  <div class="col-md-7">.col-md-7</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
		  <div class="col-md-4">.col-md-4</div>
		  <div class="col-md-4">.col-md-4</div>
		  <div class="col-md-4">.col-md-4</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	```

## Including Bootstrap with HTML

* To use Bootstrap, we need to include Bootstrap's CSS and Javascript libraries (+ or - an optional Bootstrap-Theme CSS file).
* We also need to include jQuery, as Bootstrap's JS plug-ins depend on it.  
* There are a few different ways to accomplish this, listed below. In this class, we'll keep it simple and stick with the CDN.

1. CDN (Content Delivery Network - someone else hosts the library/framework and you access it via a URL):  [http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download-cdn](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download-cdn). Where do we include these in our HTML file?
2. Download the actual CSS and JS files and link to them on your local computer - better for offline/local development.

## Responsive Grid System

#### Page layout using the Grid System
![grid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sf-wdi-26/modules/master/w02/d03/m3-bootstrap/imgs/grid.png)

**Note:** There's an error in the image above. Can you find it? Maybe after you have a bit more background on the 12 column layout system.

Bootstrap's grid system is based on the idea that a page layout for any given screen size is represented with 12 fluid **columns**.  Columns are always horizontally contained in **rows**, which in turn are contained inside of a larger `container` (container > row > column). But why 12?

#### 12 is the best number

12 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6 (meaning we can have columns that are: half-width, third-width, quarter-width, and sixth-width aka 50%, ~33.3%, 25%, and ~16.7%):

    12/2  = 6
    12/3  = 4
    12/4  = 3
    12/6  = 2
    12/12 = 1

    6 + 6                                           = 12
    4 + 4 + 4                                       = 12
    3 + 3 + 3 + 3                                   = 12
    2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2                           = 12
    1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1   = 12

We can also create the typical two column layout (main content area + sidebar):

    8 + 4                                           = 12
    9 + 3                                           = 12



#### Start with a container
To ensure all your Bootstrap styles behave properly, always put your content inside an element with a class "container" (usually `<div class="container">`). This will center your content and leave a small margin on the sides of the page. If you would like to use the full width of the screen (no margin) use `class="container-fluid"`

#### Add a row

To use the grid system we must put a row in our container:

  ```html
   <div class="row"> ... </div>
  ```

#### Specify your columns

* Columns are written in the following format as a class: `col-(breakpoint)-(width)`
* For example: `col-sm-4`

 Then select what screen size we'll want it to display on:
  - `col-xs` < 768px (e.g. smartphones)
  - `col-sm` ≥ 992px (e.g. tablets)
  - `col-md` ≥ 1200px (e.g. laptops, desktops)
  - `col-lg` ≥ 1200px (e.g. large desktops, smart TVs)

* At screen sizes smaller than the specified screen sizes, the columns will default to filling the width of the screen.

* Pick a fraction of `12` that will determine how much of the row it will take up.

* You then use the above choices to determine the exact class you will add to an element in the row (bootstrap has them all built in).

For example the class: `col-lg-3` will take up `3/12` of the space at `1200px`. Feel free to add more classes to the same element to change how it will behave at other screen sizes. Let's checkout some more examples...

Here's an example of a two-column layout that spans the width of the page.  Notice that the widths of the two columns add up to 12.  The column content of any row must always be ≤12.

```html
 <div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-6">
     <p>I'm a medium-sized column</p>
    </div>
   <div class="col-md-6">
     <p>Me too! We have SO much in common</p>
   </div>
 </div>
```

What will this code do?

```html
 <div class="row">
   <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
     <p>I take up the entire space when the screen is small, but share it when there's more room.</p>
    </div>
   <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
     <p>Samesies...</p>
   </div>
 </div>
```

### Challenge: Grid it
1. How much of the page would elements with these classes take up?

  * `col-md-2`
  * `col-sm-1`
  * `col-lg-8`
  * `col-xs-12`


1. Using the bootstrap grid, make a grid that is 3 Columns on Tablet (sm), Laptop (md), and Desktop (lg), 1 Column on Mobile(xs).

<details><summary>Sample code</summary>

```html
<div class="row">
  <h3 class='text-center'>3 Columns on Tablet, Laptop, and Desktop, 1 Column on Mobile</h3>
  <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12">Yao</div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12">Hey</div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12">Ola</div>
</div>
```

</details>



For other examples, check out the [Bootstrap docs](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid)  

## Offsets & Nesting
You can also offset and nest your columns. When you offset a column, you add a column of whitespace and push the column to the right.  Example:

```html
 <div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-3 col-md-offset-3">
     <p>This column occupies 1/4 of the page width and is moved to the right by 1/4 of the page width</p>
   </div>
 </div>
```
Here is an example of nesting columns (putting one row inside another)

```html
 <div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-6">
     Level 1: Column takes 1/2 the width of the page
     <div class="row">
       <div class="col-md-4">
         Level 2: This column takes 1/3 the width of its parent column
       </div>
       <div class="col-md-8">
         Level 2: This column takes 2/3 the width of its parent column
       </div>
     </div>
   </div>
 </div>
```

## Typography
For a complete list: [Bootstrap Typography classes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type)

To align text, use these classes.  

```html
 <p class="text-left">Left aligned text.</p>
 <p class="text-center">Center aligned text.</p>
 <p class="text-right">Right aligned text.</p>
 <p class="text-justify">Justified text.</p>
 <p class="text-nowrap">No wrap text.</p>
```
More useful typography classes...

```html
 <p class="lead">This text will stand out in a paragraph</p>
 <small>This line of text is meant to be treated as fine print.</small>
 <p class="text-lowercase">Lowercased text.</p>
 <p class="text-uppercase">Uppercased text.</p>
 <p class="text-capitalize">Capitalized text.</p>
```

#### Icons
Bootstrap comes with a set of icons that can be included in your page using the `<i></i>` tag. Check out these icons [here](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons)

#### Buttons
Bootstrap provides a wide selection of button sizes and colors.  Button classes can be applied not just to `<button>` elements, but also `<a>` and `<input>` elements

Sometimes you need to provide multiple classes to an element in order for Bootstrap to style it.  The button classes are an example of this:

```html
 <!-- Standard button -->
 <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">Default</button>

 <!-- Provides extra visual weight and identifies the primary action in a set of buttons -->
 <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>

 <!-- Contextual button for informational alert messages -->
 <button type="button" class="btn btn-info">Info</button>

 <!-- Indicates caution should be taken with this action -->
 <button type="button" class="btn btn-warning">Warning</button>
```  
... and so on.  See the [docs](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons) for a comprehensive list of options.  Note you can add a third class denoting size to any of the above: `.btn-lg`, `.btn-sm`, `.btn-xs`


### Images
Bootstrap helps you format images using `class="img-rounded"` (rounds the corners), `class="img-circle"` (makes the image a circle) and `class="img-thumbnail"` (adds a border). You can also add a `class="img-responsive"` to your image to make it scale well when the screen size changes (this sets its max-width to 100% of its parent element and the height to auto for maintaining aspect)

### Forms
Bootstrap is also very helpful when you need to style your forms. All textual `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` elements with `class="form-control"` are set to width: 100% by default. Wrap labels and their associated controls (inputs) in `class="form-group"` for optimum spacing.

### Javascript plug-ins
Bootstrap allows you to incorporate interactive behavior into your page with Javascript plug-ins.  While you would ultimately have to write some JS in order for these components to provide actual functionality within the application, you don't have to write JS if you're simply mocking up a UI.

Some examples:

- [Responsive Nav bars](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar)
- [Dropdowns](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#dropdowns)
- [Popovers](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers)
- [Modals](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals)
- [Carousels](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel)


#### Independent Practice

Open [starter-code/bootstrap](starter-code/bootstrap) in your text editor. 

1. Take a look at grid.png.
2. Recreate the grid in your HTML.
	- You should not need to add any CSS!

#### Bootstrap vs. Custom Grid System

Discuss the following question with a partner:

When might it be better to use an established grid system, such as Bootstrap? When might it be better to use a custom-made grid system?



## Closing Thoughts

Bootstrap demonstrates good practices in terms of exemplifying class-based CSS and introducing the concept of a grid-system. It is useful for most projects where style is somewhat important but not the central to the product.

Be aware that critical users of the web know what bootstrap looks like; it’s all over the place! If you’re making a serious project or portfolio work, add some of your own stylings to stand out!
