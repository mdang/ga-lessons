## How Alexa Works

When a user speaks to an Alexa-enabled device, the speech is streamed to the Alexa service in the cloud. Alexa recognizes the speech, determines what the user wants, and then sends a structured request to the particular skill that can fulfill the userâ€™s request. All speech recognition and conversion is handled by Alexa in the cloud.

Every Alexa skill has an interaction model defining the words and phrases users can say to make the skill do what they want. The type of skill you build dictates the interaction model that Alexa uses to communicate with your users.
